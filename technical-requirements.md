# Technical Requirements:

* We need to create a constructor function to create company instances that include propeerties that correspond to the form input so we can match the user to a company.

* We need  to include an About Page, which will require HTML and CSS styling.

* We need to create list items in a for loop for each company and append them to the UL we created in our HTML.

* We need to include dropdown menus to limit the possible responses the user can give so it's simpler to analyze the results.

* We need to create an HTML scaffold for our home page, use CSS to style it, and use JS to store the user's name input.

* We need to set the user's name input and their results to local storage so that we can use their name throughout and keep the results for the user's next visit.

## STRETCH GOALS:

* We need small CSS microinteractions to engage the user.


* We need to wipe out the inner HTML of the form so we can display only the results to  the user once they have completed the questionnaire.

* We need to use Chart JS to display percentage matches for the user's responses to each company.

* We need to give weight to each catagory so the user can determine how important each question is to them. We would incriment their counter by how important they ranked that category to be.
