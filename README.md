# Culture Fit

## Description
Culture Fit is designed to match Code Fellows students and graduates with a work environment that would be most fitting to thier personal style. As of right now, the pool of companies is limited to 10 that have hired Code Fellows graduates before.  We are measureing on several metrics.
* What coding language does the company use primarily
* Does that company offer or allow flexible hours or a work-from-home option
* Is there a particular stress-reliever that the company offers such as ping pong or darts
* What type of environment is it? High pressure or relatively open-ended and lower stress
* Does the company offer any type of sponsored volunteering program or reimburse you for volunteer hours
* What size is the company
