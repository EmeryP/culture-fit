            <p>My background is in manufacturing and specifically mechanical design and precision CNC machining. Over the past year and a half I have been focused on building a business that provides test instruments to help companies in the electronics industry increase the quality and performance of the touch input devices they develop. During this time I was exposed to the various uses of software and actually built and sold a software solution to control a robot. This experience identifying a need, building a solution and selling it intrigued me to want to learn more about how I can improve the world with software. My name is Emery Parks and I am an entrepreneur, marketer, and front-end software developer.<br/></p>

            <p>Detail-obsessed, task-focused, group-enhancer, self-motivator are just some of the adjectives to describe my working style.

                Paying attention to the nitty-gritty has always been a part of my job in every position that I have held. While graduating Suma Cum Laude with a Bachelors in Legal Office Administration prepared me for detail-oriented work, it was honed by interning in law offices reviewing evidence files, analyzing construction job needs and providing timely deliveries, and performing quality checks on thousands of challenge coins sold to the military. Completely diverse jobs but all connected in that they require extreme attention to detail and time-management skills to meet strict deadlines.<br/><br/>
                
                As a project coordinator, I discovered a need for additional training on a newly introduced software program among my commercial sales team and developed a training manual that fully explained each step. Using the manual allowed my salesmen greater autonomy in the field and a better relationship with their customers. <br/><br/>
                
                Starting as an assistant and working my way up to General Manager of a small business exposed me to new levels of organization needs and detail-related tasks. I strive to create a lean work-flow environment. Streamlining data flow for easy snapshot information on each project was a massive undertaking but once in place, it allowed for a much more efficient and accurate quoting and tracking method. <br/><br/>
                
                I thrive on creating win-win situations for all parties involved whether it is a negotiation or a group discussion. Mitigating negative feelings before they develop and making people feel involved and needed is a passion of mine. As a great listener. I listen to not only what is said, but what is unsaid. Listening to hear and understand, not just reply. I make people feel comfortable and truly value their conversation. People say that I am a wonderful encourager and very sincere. As such, I am a great addition to team projects.<br/></p>
