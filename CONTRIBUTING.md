Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other?
Slack and in person. Make sure notifications are on and be willing to share opinions. Use @person so they get a notification. Generally keeping Slack questions late in the evening simple. Open communication in group Slack. 
 What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
When a new idea is presented, everyone give constructive ideas related to it and recognizes the person’s idea.
 Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety, as we learned about in the article on Google and teams from Class 14?
Speak up when bothered by something. Go to someone else for support if needed. 
Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
Compromise. Hear each party out. Weigh passion and logical conviction into the equation. Identify the feeling and talk about the feeling if emotions get intense.
Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
Schedule set up in Projects and know what each person is working on.
Monday at noon is our designated, latest pitch time.
Check-ins daily, code review of yesterday in the morning where we discuss goals for the day as well.
Use Projects to assign tasks people like within each language and be able to visually see that it’s about equal.
Git process: What is your Git flow? 
Branch from master onto a test branch, merge with that test branch all day. Only clean code on master branch.
Naming convention for branches: dayname-portionofassignment.
Commit messages have specificdate-portionofassignment.
How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?
The other pair for the day so everyone’s eyes have been on the code at least once.
Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc. 
We addressed this earlier, but will flesh this out more as the week goes on.
